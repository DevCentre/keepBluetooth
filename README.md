# keepBluetooth
An small script to enforce bluetooth connection (MacOS).



<b>WHY</b><br>
<p>This repository was created to share the best solution I came up with to enforce my bluetooth connection. I have an bluetooth headset that keep turning off automatically after ridiculous ~3 seconds ! I mean, it is a nice battery feature to turn itself off when no sound is beeing played, but 3 seconds is too low for that, and as I coundn't figure it out how to increase this time of turn it off I decided to write this simple shell script.</p>


<br><br>
<b>SUPORTED PLATAFORMs</b><br>
<p>Although it(script) uses a macos 'exclusive' binary, with this concept you <em>should</em> be able to modify and adapt to your own enviroment.</p>

<br>
<b>CODE</b>
<code>
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/@@@.aiff -v 0.0001
</code>


<br>
<b>USE</b>
<p>Get the script - forkit, git clone, download zip, copy and paste and save it as <b>***.sh</b> - your choice.<br>
Then, run it <b>./keepBluetooth.sh</b></p>
